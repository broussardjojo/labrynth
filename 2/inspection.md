`board: 0/80`

- You lose all programming points in this milestone for using none to represent empty space with no explixit documentation about this(See fundies 2). If you think this is harsh then see(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybrQvs4x0Ps). If you still not  convinced then present your case during office hours.

- 30/40 pts: an operation that determines the reachable tiles from some spot
  - [0/10] : is there a data def. for "coordinates" (places to go to)? 
    - couldnt find this
  - [10/10] : is there a signature/purpose statement? 
  - [10/10] : is it clear how the method/function checks for cycles? 
  - [10/10] : is there at least one unit test with a non-empty expected result

- 20/30 pts an operation for sliding a row or column in a direction 
  - [10/10] sig/purp.
  - [0/10] the method should check that row/column has even index 
     - you throw invalid slide based on direction
  - [10/10] unit tests: at least one for rows and one for columns

- 10/10 pts an operation for rotating and inserting the spare tile
 


`state.md (Ungraded)`
- Please read the milestone to know whats expected of your design doc. Hint data definitions described in your pl. You would have gotten a zero was this graded.
