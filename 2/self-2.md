## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. point to the functinality for determining reachable tiles 

   - a data representation for "reachable tiles" 
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/board.py#L213-L221
   
   - its signature and purpose statement
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/board.py#L213-L218
   
   - its "cycle detection" coding (accumulator)
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/board.py#L223-L241
   
   - its unit test(s)
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/test_board.py#L152-L171

2. point to the functinality for shifting a row or column 

   - its signature and purpose statement
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/board.py#L90-L99
   
   - unit tests for rows and columns
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/test_board.py#L30-L97

3. point to the functinality for inserting a tile into the open space

   - its signature and purpose statement
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/board.py#L198-L204
   
   - unit tests for rows and columns
   
   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/f4e8bd4b33b3175be9d6025993b61150e7ad3d88/Maze/Common/test_board.py#L100-L149

If you combined pieces of functionality or separated them, explain.

If you think the name of a method/function is _totally obvious_,
there is no need for a purpose statement. 

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
