## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 3

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

1. rotate the spare tile by some number of degrees

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/32acda181e733db1664bb2e0cd920c358331ddfa/Maze/Common/state.py#L25-L37

2. shift a row/column and insert the spare tile

   https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/32acda181e733db1664bb2e0cd920c358331ddfa/Maze/Common/state.py#L159-L172   

   - plus its unit tests

   Tests for moving players that were bumped off: https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/32acda181e733db1664bb2e0cd920c358331ddfa/Maze/Common/test_state.py#L287-L334

   Tests for sliding and inserting: https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/32acda181e733db1664bb2e0cd920c358331ddfa/Maze/Common/test_board.py#L30-L97
   
3. move the avatar of the currently active player to a designated spot

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/32acda181e733db1664bb2e0cd920c358331ddfa/Maze/Common/state.py#L145-L157

4. check whether the active player's move has returned its avatar home

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/32acda181e733db1664bb2e0cd920c358331ddfa/Maze/Common/state.py#L134-L143

5. kick out the currently active player

https://github.khoury.northeastern.edu/CS4500-F22/mactaggartt-rodriguezdia/blob/32acda181e733db1664bb2e0cd920c358331ddfa/Maze/Common/state.py#L123-L132

The ideal feedback for each of these points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
