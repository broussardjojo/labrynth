- imagine a 7x7 board with 4 players
  - total of 9 immovable tiles; 4 are homes, 9 are goals (incl. homes)
  - each player reaches 2 goals, leaving 1 goal in the to be acquired list
  - Imagine 1 goal remains
    - This means the previous 8 have been assigned
    - Once that last goal becomes assigned, there's no assertion any other goal has to change
- Things we need to change
  - Ref has to have an ordered list of goals, pref. scrambled at creation time, and hand these in setup calls to players
  - ~~Scoring has to be changed to be ordered by 1) number of goals reached 2) euclidean distance to next goal~~
    - Should already be implemented
- Implementation
  - Helper method architecture
    - in __generate_players, pass in a sequence of goals with the same length as the number of players to create
      - All of the eligible goal tiles not passed in this list can be stored in the sequence of additional goals
      - How does this start from a state?
        - RefState data definition asserts no player has reached any assigned goal, so we could perform the same logic
        - Would need to put this in multiple places in the code, so we would want to factor out this logic
          - `additional_goals = [all_goals - assigned_goals].shuf`
        - Constructor flag for "referee should assign additional goals" vs not?
          - ~~Either a flag or~~ some config class that the referee references

Things to implement:
- ~~Config class~~
  - Includes boolean flag for "assign_additional_goals"
  - Include timeouts / etc for remote communication so we don't just keep changing default values
  - Consider overwriting default `__init__` for field verification
- Refactoring assigned/additional goals for the Referee
  - ~~See `referee\referee.py:198` - change get_home_position to a helper to get next goal position `referee.get_next_goal_position`, which takes in a referee_player_details~~
  - ~~Class field to store additional goals in Referee~~
  - Make sure we update the number of goals a player reaches
  - ? Make sure that if a setup call fails we do remove the goal
    - Currently working with belief that if the goal is sent from the Referee with setup it is no longer eligible [(source)](https://piazza.com/class/l7g9e46cc2l4d3/post/224)

- Make sure we do turn order youngest -> oldest (last player connected to server -> first player connected to server)
- xclients should wait 3 seconds between launching clients to avoid nondeterminism
