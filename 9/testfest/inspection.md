## Program Inspection

- [20/20] for an accurate and helpful self evaluation. 

_Points_

- [28/40] Each of these functions should have a good name or a purpose statement.
  - [6/10] Top-level scoring method. 
    - Your function name is wierd. You say it  "get the player or players who are closest to victory (either the players that have reached their goal and are closest to home" but then it returns a list of winners.
  - [6/10] Find players that have visited the highest number of goals 
    - for saying you didnt abstract this out.
  - [10/10] Compute their distances to the home tile
  - [6/10] Pick those with the shortest distance as winners
    - for saying you didnt abstract this out
- [40/40] These functions should have unit tests
