## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 7

Indicate below each bullet which file/unit takes care of each task:

The require revision calls for

    - the relaxation of the constraints on the board size
    - a suitability check for the board size vs player number 

1. Which unit tests validate the implementation of the relaxation?

2. Which unit tests validate the suitability of the board/player combination? 

We did not unit test this modification. Here is a link to the code in a Referee which enforces this constraint:

The ideal feedback for each of these three points is a GitHub
perma-link to the range of lines in a specific file or a collection of
files.

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

You may wish to add a sentence that explains how you think the
specified code snippets answer the request.

If you did *not* realize these pieces of functionality, say so.
